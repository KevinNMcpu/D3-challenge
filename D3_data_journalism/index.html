          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Income and Per Capita Rate of Smokers</h2>
          <p>For this project, I chose to example a possible correlation between a state's average income and the percentage of smokers in that state.</p>

          <p>There is somewhat of a correlation between household income and percentage of the population that smokes. It seems very likely that a poorer state will have a high percentage of smokers. But, the correlation is not as strong for the higher income states, there is a wider spread of smoking percentage.</p>

          <p>Some cultural factors came into play. You may notice Utah as an outlier. That is likely explained by the majority of Utah's population being members of the Latter-day Saints church (Mormon), and that church prohibiting tobacco use for their members.</p>
          <p>Virginia's high tobacco use for its income level may be explained by its historical status as a major tobacco-producing state (the so-called "Tobacco Belt").</p>
          <p>Alaska's outlying position (high income, high tobacco use) may be caused by Alaska being a low popuation of state with a high number of well-paying oil/gas jobs.</p>
